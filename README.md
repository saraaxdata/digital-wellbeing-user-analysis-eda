## ⭐ Business Problem 
MindEase is a digital wellness app helping users manage stress, sleep better, and build healthier screen-time habits. Before launching a new Digital Balance Coach feature, the team needs data-driven insights on how user behaviors (screen-time, sleep quality, social media usage) relate to mental well-being.  

Despite high engagement, many users still report stress, poor sleep, and digital fatigue.
The product team does not know:
* which user segments are most at risk
* what behaviors drive poor well-being
* how to personalize recommendations
Without these insights, the feature roadmap cannot be prioritized.

## ⭐ Business Task
As the Data Analyst, your task is to analyze user behavior patterns to:
* identify high-risk user segments
* uncover behavioral factors linked to poor mental health outcomes
* provide insights that guide Digital Balance Coach feature decisions


## ⭐ Business Questions
1. Which behaviors (screen-time, sleep quality, addiction score) are most correlated with poor mental well-being?
2. Which user segments (age, gender, usage levels) show the highest risk of stress or low mood?
3. At what screen-time threshold do we see significant declines in mental well-being?
4. What patterns predict poor sleep or high stress?
5. What product opportunities or interventions does the data suggest?

## ⭐ Tools  
* Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* EDA & Statistical Exploration

## ⭐ Dataset  
Source: Social Media & Mental Health Balance dataset (Kaggle)
